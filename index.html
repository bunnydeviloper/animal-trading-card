       Master Po Ping is a anthropomorphic giant panda in his 20s, who is improbably chosen as the Dragon Warrior,
       champion of the Valley of Peace. He's the adoptive son of Mr. Ping, and is one of Master Shifu's students.
       Po is also the prophesied Dragon Warrior, as well as the warrior of black and white.
